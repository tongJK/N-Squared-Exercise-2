Exercise 2: Randomness Test

In a lottery game, there is a container which contains 50 balls numbered from 1 to 50. The lottery game consists in picking 10 balls out of the container, and ordering them in ascending order. Write a Python function which generates the output of a lottery game (it should return a list). Also describe which unit tests you could implement to test the output of your function.
